### Hi, I’m Hazel 👋

Pharmacist with 4 years of experience, grounded in a scientific approach to problem‑solving—asking “why,” thinking analytically, and communicating with precision required within the healthcare industry.

I pivoted into data and AI through a Master’s program at McGill, where I built machine learning models from the ground up—spanning supervised/unsupervised learning and deep learning (forecasting, classification, NLP, and computer vision). I’m especially interested in building scalable, robust ML pipelines that drive business impact.

My work interest is in building ML models that sharpen decision‑making: uncovering the drivers behind observed patterns so teams can act proactively and improve outcomes. I enjoy translating analysis into practical strategies and implementations that move the needle. I also care deeply about scalability and fit within real systems by making models dependable in production: designing end‑to‑end flows that run smoothly and reliably feels like putting pieces of a puzzle together - rewarding and satisfying.
